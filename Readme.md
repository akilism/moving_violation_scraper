NYPD Moving Violation Data
Scraped From .PDFs available at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/traffic_reports/traffic_summons_reports.shtml
raw_data directories currently only hold 2013 data.
It should scrape all available .pdfs if you place them in directories under raw_data/pdf and they will end up in raw_data/json/
