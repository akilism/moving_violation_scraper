NYPD Moving Violation Data Scraper
==================================

Scrapes .PDFs available at: http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/traffic_reports/traffic_summons_reports.shtml

It should scrape all available .pdfs if you place them in directories under raw_data/pdf and they will end up in raw_data/json

A tiny bit of spot checking has been done but that is all.

Sample PDF and JSON file have been supplied.
